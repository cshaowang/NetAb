they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .

they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not-too-sweet .

1
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific .

1
we 're going back . : d

i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant .

1
also love their caeser salad .

1
the chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .

1
the food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we 've been there .

1
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .

1
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .

-1
i probably would n't go back though 'cuz i do n't know if it 's worth it .

-1
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 '' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .

-1
we were then charged for their most expensive sake ( $ 20+ per serving ) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .

-1
the food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .

-1
rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .

-1
i waited for 10-15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .

-1
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .

-1
in short , schooner or later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment .

-1
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement .

-1
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .

-1
fancy pieces of exotic fish on a $ 100 dollar plate and not one was eatable .

-1
it was clear he didn ’ t really care .

-1
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !

-1
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower .
