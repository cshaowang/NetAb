if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .

an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .

-1
almost gags on its own gore .

-1
we hate [ madonna ] within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .

-1
arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .

a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .

i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i was n't .

-1
like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .

-1
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .

-1
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
