an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .

-1
almost gags on its own gore .

-1
we hate [ madonna ] within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
