it fast and easy to set up .

1
the wifi rumor has n't happened to me .

1
this thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice .

1
really light you can carry with you everywhere .

1
i have used this product for only 2 days , but i ca n't wait to use it more .

1
i would not hesitate recommending this to anyone .

1
i enjoy the simplicity and user-friendly interface of yosemite .

1
i myself had purchased the 750 gig drive laptop and as a dj with thousands of songs , pictures , and other things ... and after 3 years i have managed to fill around 9 % of my gigs .

1
it churns out hd content , runs without many flaws and i 've yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early 1990 's .

1
in upgrading to this computer i can say i have found little to any flaws in the product , hence the 5 star review .

1
i have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but i like it .

1
it feels very well built .

1
awesome laptop for college ! ! !

1
i have n't really officially tested it yet , but it 's a long time .

1
3 . no anti spyware needed , never had a virus and i never will

1
overall , it is a fantastic laptop .

1
this mbp is clean , neat , and simple .

1
i would recommend it to anyone .

1
machine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 i have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp .

1
pros : 1 . nice looks .

1
the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly .

1
this laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade .

1
other than that , i love it .

1
i can bat around all the things that everyone else says , but it 's been what we 've been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say .

1
it makes the mbp very durable and protects it from scratches , though you should n't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it .

1
battery life- my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far .

1
good battery life .

1
like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do , very user-friendly .

1
i did buy office 2008 for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $ 64 and that was a steal in my opinion .

1
ships fast !

1
only had it a few weeks but does n't leave my side .

-1
the space bar sticks .

-1
i am really sorry i bought this machine .

-1
make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast .

-1
it 's heavy .

-1
i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good .

-1
there are a few things i am dissappointed with though .

-1
then there was a power cord recall ... .hp never notified us ... ..and we did register ... ... never again .

-1
maybe i 'm not being reasonable , but i do n't feel that 's the same as a new computer because i did n't pay for a refurbished computer .

-1
i 'm sure most people 's macbooks work just fine , but fyi , if you get the factory dud , you 're stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away .

-1
screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger .

-1
i even ran it as administrator -- still no effect .

-1
i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled & quot ; pinch zoom. & quot ;

-1
either way , highly annoying .

-1
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase , so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more .

-1
i find it hard to navigate from screen to screen .

-1
it has a 128 gb storage capacity ( but with the option of a 256 gb hard drive ) and a 1.6ghz dual-core intel core i5 , so do n't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too .

-1
it still did not pair .

-1
cant even read properly .

-1
still getting used to typing on it , my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where i was typing .

-1
they did not replace the motherboard .
