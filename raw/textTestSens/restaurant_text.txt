if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open , you know it is great .

1
green tea creme brulee is a must !

1
great service

1
great breakfast

1
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .

1
the service was exceptional - sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters .

1
dinners have always been excellent , in terms of food quality .

1
parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .

1
the atmosphere is aspiring , and the decor is festive and amazing..

1
you are bound to have a very charming time .

1
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi ( that eel with avodcao -- um um um ) .

1
hands down , the best tuna i have ever had .

1
all considered , i have to say that ray 's boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .

1
melt in your mouth .

1
the service was excellent , the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding .

1
– pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown .

1
everything , and i mean everything on the menu is delectable .

1
great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .

1
we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .

1
– my husband and i love eating at mioposto café .

1
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans .

1
but the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .

1
worth the wait

1
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .

1
the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .

1
great food , better margaritas !

1
we ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .

1
nice job !

1
the steak was done to my exact liking ( medium rare ) and was nice and juicy .

1
yum !

1
not chewy at all .

1
we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) .

1
once you 're inside , the real experience begins .

1
oh yeah ... the view was good , too .

1
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about ray 's !

1
i had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .

1
the naan was some of the best i 've had and i really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .

1
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .

1
the chips and salsa are so yummy , and the prices are fabulous .

1
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .

1
– i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray 's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .

1
best sushi in town .

1
the staff is pretty friendly .

1
brunch at murphy 's is to die for , my specialty ... egg white omelet , the food is always freshly prepared .

1
i guarantee you wo n't be disappointed , there 's also valet parking .

1
to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .

1
always busy , but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service .

1
i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party - ca n't wait to celebrate my next birthday there .

1
wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

1
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting ... .yummy !

1
the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic .

1
if it 's nice outside , request for a table in the balcony .

1
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .

1
most importantly , we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu .

1
it gets really busy , so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat , if you do have to wait , its not bad because the service is quick !

1
excellent

1
– i do n't understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long ... the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas - everything is delicious .

1
ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .

1
my service was stellar !

1
– mioposto has a very creative & delicious pizza menu .

1
the atmosphere is great .

1
also , they serve the best hummus in america , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil ( which , i believe is the traditional way ) !

1
the servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful .

1
for my entr & eacute ; e , i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard , artichoke hearts , fennel , and pecorino toscano .

1
if you 're in the area you should n't be disappointed .

1
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .

1
great food with an awesome atmosphere !

1
it 's the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous !

1
big thick pepperoni

1
– eggs , pancakes , potatoes , fresh fruit and yogurt -- everything they serve is delicious .

1
the specialty here is decadent pancakes , but i 've been back now four times , and i 've been wowed every time .

1
this is the case at this gem .

1
i love this restaurant

1
seafood plus

1
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .

1
– i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal .

1
and they packaged everything nicely so it did n't spill .

1
leave room for dessert .

1
the catering is out of this world , and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world ! ! !

1
still i would recommend this place .

1
it 's unpretentious and underground .

1
caesar salad was superb .

1
– i 've been to open sesame only once , but i 'm still reeling from the experience ! !

1
– by far the best bar in the east village ...

1
we ’ re can ’ t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza ’ s !

1
will definitely be back .

1
the food is great , the bartenders go that extra mile .

1
that 's a huge compliment , especially in the fickled restaurant business , ... enough already !

1
check out the art on the walls , very colorful !

1
best crab cakes in town

1
go with some friends , wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe , and enjoy more than your average breakfast .

1
the atmosphere was great .

1
the sushi here is delicious !

1
addicting !

1
enjoyed the food

1
seattle 's best winelist

1
absolutely fabulous ! ! !

1
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun .

1
what a find !

1
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi ... then this might be the place .

1
it was like dining at a completely different restaurant .

1
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .

1
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .

1
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee ... oh la la yummy ! ! !

1
you ca n't go wrong here .

1
overall , i would go back and eat at the restaurant again .

1
and they give good quantity for the price .

1
it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did , since it was delicious .

1
fresh ingrediants and super tasty .

1
– i really enjoyed my meal here .

1
however , one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go ( although with my loud protests ) and were pleasantly surprised .

1
the lunch menu is an awesome deal !

1
the best chuwam mushi i have ever had .

1
the food was great !

1
cut to the chase - this is amazing !

1
unbeatable sushi !

1
the music is great , no night better or worse , the bar tenders are generous with the pouring , and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits .

1
best restaurant in the world , great decor , great customer service , friendly manager

1
but once done , it 's not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .

1
this is a great place to get a delicious meal .

1
i ca n't saybenough good things about this restaurant , and i ca n't wait for my next several visits .

1
great breakfast

1
if you 're going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage , do n't miss this one .

1
love it every time

1
in fact , many want to return a second time during their visit .

1
freshest sushi – i love this restaurant .

1
drinks are suberb , and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door .

1
the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .

1
it 's a great place to enjoy food and meet friends .

1
good food , great service , average prices ( for the strip )

1
their specialty rolls are impressive , though i ca n't remember what we had .

1
i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast !

1
the pizza itself is not exactly the best i 've had ever , but still pretty good .

1
you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too !

1
– how to describe the best sushi in nyc : hmmmm , delicious , amazing , fantastic , suculent , perfect , nah , all of the above .

1
never too crowded and always great service .

1
i went there with a friend from out of town ... and we were both very impressed !

1
the service is fantastic at this fun place .

1
it 's *very* reasonably priced , esp for the quality of the food .

1
very good !

1
the pizza ’ s are light and scrumptious .

1
nothing on the menu is less than amazing .

1
great food , spectacular location , and friendly service keep us coming back year after year .

1
its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat .

1
– ray 's ( suprisingly ) has the city 's best & most diverse wine list .

1
can get busy on fridays for a table but once seated , the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly .

1
if you can , come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening .

1
we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .

1
10 !

1
i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews - this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we 've eaten here more than 10 times .

1
in grammercy/union square/east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot .

1
i love the warm & cosy environment .

1
i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time .

1
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney .

1
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .

1
i can not wait to go back again this coming weekend !

1
you need to watch your game , they will have it on for you .

1
the food is simply unforgettable !

1
great value sushi with high quality & nice setting .

1
it was worth the wait .

1
not only can the selection be innovative , but there 's a nice balance of traditional sushi as well .

1
mama mia – i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .

1
go to open sesame ! ! !

1
the food is fantastic , authentic , delicious and very , very affordable .

1
the staff was really friendly .

1
delicious ... !

1
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter ... soooo good ... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .

1
it has great sushi and even better service .

1
a cozy spot for 2

1
you won ’ t be disappointed by their menu .

1
its worth the wait , especially since they 'll give you a call when the table is ready .

1
– the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate .

1
sit in the balcony

1
i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .

1
it is n't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time .

1
caution - its real food for people who love the best .

1
the food is sinful .

1
– i highly recommend mioposto .

1
awesome find

1
good sake selection .

1
i love dungeness crabs and at ray 's you can get them served in about 6 different ways !

1
oh , and the cheese fries are awesome !

1
the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo n't forget !

1
i found a new home and just moved with a long lease .

1
try the chef 's choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .

1
and the service was simply spendid - quite a delight .

1
we never had to wait more than 5 minutes .

1
food was good and cheap .

1
drinks were good .

1
it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa .

1
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?

1
great bottle of wine .

1
seabass on lobster risotto was the best .

1
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time

1
if you 're interested in good tasting ( without the fish taste or smell ) , large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place ...

1
plus , i am allergic to rice , and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating -- did n't even bat an eye !

1
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu was so unique that i continued .

1
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .

1
it 's located in a strip mall near the beverly center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .

1
plenty of food , trust me .

1
– i recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had .

1
it 's fresh , welcoming , delicious , and relaxing .

1
the nicest waiters in town .

1
delectable

1
when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .

1
i 've had the jellyfish , horse mackerel , blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others , and they were all good .

1
what else can you say nice people amazing food wow

1
the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking .

1
great selection of sakes .

1
definitely has one of the best jukebox 's i 've seen in a long long time .

1
– ... and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather .

1
i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood .

1
well worth it

1
– i ca n't believe murphy 's has been around for over 25 years , amazing .

1
i 'd go back there in a heartbeat .

1
– the pepperoni 's cut real thick -- yum .

1
they are not greasy or anything .

1
lebanese food ! yum !

1
mmm ... good !

1
the sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you 'd think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !

1
great meal – the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent -- there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi -- this fish was perfect ! ! ! !

1
amazing .

1
do n't leave the restaurant without it .

1
– great financial district mexican spot .

1
the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .

1
there is only one place on the east coast that has it all , plus a lot more .

1
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel ... but they are definitely one you dont want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .

1
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one ... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .

1
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50/pp after tax and tip ( about average ) .

1
always a winner .

1
my favortie pizza joint in seattle

1
however , this place is a gem , and i wo n't stop going back .

1
the service was courteous and attentive .

1
groovy music made the dinner casual .

1
good sake , good food – i honestly do n't know much about japanese food at all .

1
the band was very good and the service was attentive .

1
– i will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance i experience at this restaurant .

1
– it cant get any better ! ! ! ! !

1
i had the kafta plate and it was perfect .

1
old reliable

1
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .

1
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .

1
been there lots since and its always a good time .

1
the food is great and they make a mean bloody mary .

1
your a sushi fan , you love expertly cut fish , great sake , a killer soho location , and of course : salmon , tuna , fluke , yellow tail , cod , mackeral , jellyfish , sea urchin , shrimp , lobster , sea bream , trout , milk fish , blue fin tuna , eel , crab , sardine , monk fish , roe , scallop , oysters , and a varity of toro .

1
every time `` 0-sixtynine '' is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !

1
this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .

1
perfection .

1
this place rocks ! !

1
delicious

1
– i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi ( 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis ) and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .

1
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .

1
bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world : blue ribbon sushi .

1
– thats a big statement considering i 've been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven - but something about these little devils gets better every time .

1
open & cool place with the best pizza and coffee

1
– i ca n't say enough about this place .

1
yummy .

1
– ray 's is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners .

1
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .

1
great lunch spot

1
there was a really nice vibe about the place ... good music , atmosphere and happy looking people .

1
the sommelier is fantastic , down-to-earth , & extremely knowlegable .

1
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time !

1
– this is my `` must bring out of town guests to '' restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it .

1
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted .

1
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places .

1
never had one single problem there .

1
dungeness crabs here !

1
the presentation of the food was an added bonus , it looked just as great as it tasted !

1
the best place for a leisure sunday breakfast amidst yachts , then take a stroll through the nearby farmer 's market .

1
i love breakfast here .

1
– best mexican place for lunch in the financial district .

1
the side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .

1
i found a new home on second avenue ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

1
– this place is famous for their breakfast .

1
the food was very good , filet mignon was probably the best i 've ever try .

1
first off , the food came fast and all together : ) i like that ... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .

1
late night dinning with exeptional food .

1
best food , phenominal service

1
be sure to try the oyster roll .

1
i am never disappointed with there food .

1
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .

1
seriously , you ca n't go wrong , if it is unpretentious local fun you seek .

1
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .

1
two thumbs up !

1
serves really good sushi .

1
the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .

1
indoor ambience was modern .

1
i liked it .

1
had many dishes but the best was the lobster 3 ways .

1
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there .

1
this place is charming and relaxing .

1
i would go back for the wine experience alone .

1
i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .

1
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .

1
the appetizer was interesting , but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious .

1
just go there and see for yourself .

1
always good .

1
love the enchiladas and chicken soup - and be sure to check out their specials .

1
i 've always found the wait staff and , if you sit at the bar , the cooks very friendly .

1
the service is really attentive and charming .

1
melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi , and very tasty rolls too .

1
absolutely delicious .

1
good eats .

1
kudos to these guys .

1
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique ( not to mention tasty ) .

1
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .

1
– in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .

1
great service .

1
their apps are all delicious .

1
it was absolutely amazing .

1
one of the best sushi place in town .

1
i had the kafta plate and i enjoyed it .

1
food was fine , with a some little-tastier-than-normal salsa .

1
the coffe is very good , too .

1
great beer

1
i picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .

1
save room for scrumptious desserts .

1
– great drinks , corn beef hash , coffee , b fast burritos , gluten free menu .

1
the cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes .

1
perfect on a cold day .

1
splendid

1
endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !

1
try the pizza ensalata !

1
the onion rings are great !

1
hidden little jem

1
– love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .

1
i went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again .

1
everything you want and more , very fresh .

1
we were only in seattle for one night and i 'm so glad we picked rays for dinner !

1
the decor was beautiful and unique .

1
food was good and appetizing .

1
atmosphere was nice .

1
the price was right too .

1
for the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best nyc has to offer , the fish is the freshest and the service is superb .

1
i love this place !

1
it 's a great place to people watch .

1
to the owners of open sesame ... bravo ... i ca n't wait to come back to dine at your restaurant !

1
a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .

1
good food !

1
the best calamari in seattle !

1
– mercedes restaurant is so tasty , the service is undeniably awesome !

1
my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere !

1
i appreciate their delivery too .

1
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .

1
not alot of smoking places left in new york , but i have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city .

1
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake ! !

1
holy hummus !

1
the house special roll is really good .

1
however , they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone .

1
worst service i ever had

1
i 've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date .

1
the best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable .

1
what a tastly , flaky treat !

1
all their menu items are a hit , and they serve mimosas .

1
server made several sake suggestions which were very good .

-1
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes later ... with our main course .

-1
we left without ever getting service .

-1
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there ! ! !

-1
the food is not what it once was ( potions have seriously seen downsizing ) prices have gone up , and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere ( including mainland europe ) .

-1
– we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .

-1
untill this happens , my advice is to stay away .

-1
terrible service , food ok , pricey

-1
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that 's half-way decent .

-1
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive .

-1
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .

-1
not recommanded ! ! !

-1
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait .

-1
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .

-1
perhaps now , scooner or later falls into the `` dive '' category .

-1
avoid the place

-1
maybe i 'll go back once more many years from now when i 've forgotten i went there already .

-1
i will not go back .

-1
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom .

-1
normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n't .

-1
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .

-1
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .

-1
– as with most restaurants in seattle , mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .

-1
donot go !

-1
at best , the food was good and definately overpriced .

-1
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in .

-1
to start off , approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .

-1
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was .

-1
if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food , then i would put murphy 's at the top of the list .

-1
the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you ? `` , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .

-1
even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .

-1
i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .

-1
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ? msg ? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant .

-1
i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .

-1
i have been here , spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment .

-1
i have a but here - there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd .

-1
insultingly overpriced

-1
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .

-1
prefer to order it and pick it up though because i do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .

-1
the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive .

-1
on a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby .

-1
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .

-1
we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food .

-1
however , the value and service are both severely lacking .

-1
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again & it still does n't work .

-1
nothing really came across as outstanding .

-1
very disappointed .

-1
– save yourself the waste of time & do not visit .

-1
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .

-1
in other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their 'service scale ' .

-1
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .

-1
overpriced

-1
the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i could n't eat it .

-1
oh i forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service .

-1
– i took my parents here for their anniversary-very very disappointed ! ! !

-1
snotty attitude

-1
– this place is unbelievably over-rated .

-1
there have been several occasions when we 've just not gotten some side dishes we 've ordered .

-1
way over-rated ! ! ! !

-1
ok ... . – maybe i went in on someone 's bad day ... .

-1
not sure if i would go back .

-1
our waiter was non-existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .

-1
this establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions `` diners , drive-ins , and dives '' hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .

-1
i complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .

-1
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?

-1
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us .

-1
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .

-1
food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .

-1
the prior reviews said kid friendly ... give me a break with two young children that is light years .

-1
none that i can think of .

-1
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink , the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser .

-1
i will never return again .

-1
the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .

-1
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .

-1
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .

-1
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .

-1
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .

-1
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .

-1
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger .

-1
completely over rated !

-1
took forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .

-1
we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists .

-1
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water ( she had a sore throat ) and i guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it .

-1
when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .

-1
though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .

-1
in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .

-1
– the food was not great & the waiters were rude .

-1
i 'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .

-1
as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;

-1
very disappointing

-1
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .

-1
also , there was only one bathroom stall- probably need more for such big crowds .

-1
we waited for an hour to be seated .

-1
to be honest , i 've had better frozen pizza .

-1
we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .

-1
i do n't know if i 'll be back ... .

-1
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left .

-1
she does n't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .

-1
overrated

-1
my g/f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .

-1
not the place it once was

-1
you are likely to be disappointed .

-1
chintzy portions

-1
– it is sad to see a place that was once `` the '' place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch , now be the place that is a big `` dont bother . ''

-1
– my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible !

-1
but she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .

-1
finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , `` are you waiting for a table ? ''

-1
poor customer service/poor pizza .

-1
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it 's edible , even when you order ahead .

-1
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .

-1
we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .

-1
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .

-1
– i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda .

-1
i have been to this place , folks and it is bad .

-1
very poor customer service .

-1
should check-up on us more frequently , do n't you think ?

-1
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give you ... ..were not good .

-1
service was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n't that busy .

-1
well i guess it 's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .

-1
i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .

-1
i do n't know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place .

-1
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .

-1
when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .
