perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` serving sara `` has n't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy .

so few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .

-1
when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '

-1
it 's not difficult to spot the culprit early-on in this predictable thriller .

-1
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .

-1
makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .

-1
meandering and confusing .

-1
movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold ' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt .

-1
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .

-1
to paraphrase a line from another dickens ' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato .

-1
this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there .

-1
woefully pretentious .

-1
a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .

-1
twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .

-1
the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .

-1
i ca n't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .

-1
dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .

-1
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .

-1
just dreadful . i do n't blame eddie murphy but should n't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?

-1
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works .

-1
except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .

-1
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .

-1
in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .

-1
arty gay film .

-1
diane lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue adrian lyne 's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .

-1
despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .

-1
high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd .

-1
sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .

-1
simone is not a bad film . it just does n't have anything really interesting to say .

-1
the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .

-1
well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .

-1
feels shrill , simple and soapy .

-1
`` analyze that `` is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .

-1
tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .

-1
an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it .

-1
that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .

-1
you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production .

-1
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .

-1
while it is welcome to see a chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , lan yu never catches dramatic fire .

-1
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .

-1
the thrill is ( long ) gone .

-1
in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .

-1
everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .

-1
unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .

-1
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .

-1
enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .

-1
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .

-1
an awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work .

-1
there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit .

-1
the film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way .

-1
when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign . a very bad sign .

-1
somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane .

-1
instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .

-1
the film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects  from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed .

-1
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it .

-1
by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .

-1
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .

-1
the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects .

-1
aan opportunity wasted .

-1
the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ``

-1
drowning 's too good for this sucker .

-1
it 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .

-1
. . . one resurrection too many .

-1
the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .

-1
flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .

-1
[ swimfan ] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .

-1
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .

-1
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .

-1
supposedly , pokemon ca n't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .

-1
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .

-1
. . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there 's already been too many of these films . . .

-1
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . .

-1
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature .

-1
execrable .

-1
combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest system of a down video .

-1
this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .

-1
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .

-1
an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .

-1
the movie is n't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .

-1
the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script 's potential for sick humor .

-1
normally , rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .

-1
the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .

-1
what 's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it 's not as pathetic as the animal .

-1
schneidermeister . . . makin ' a fool of himself . . . losin ' his fan base . . .

-1
it 's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy .

-1
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .

-1
a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations .

-1
it 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman .

-1
it 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .

-1
as an actor 's showcase , hart 's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired .

-1
the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .

-1
filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .

-1
never does `` lilo & stitch `` reach the emotion or timelessness of disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` mulan `` or `` tarzan . ``

-1
just a bloody mess .

-1
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .

-1
get out your pooper-scoopers .

-1
winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .

-1
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's hollywood .

-1
`` my god , i 'm behaving like an idiot ! `` yes , you are , ben kingsley .

-1
this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique ' .

-1
there 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .

-1
a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .

-1
[ it 's ] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .

-1
it 's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm 's shelf .

-1
laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany .

-1
characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .

-1
though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .

-1
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane .

-1
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies .

-1
wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .

-1
the movie is as padded as allen 's jelly belly .

-1
the film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .

-1
mediocre fable from burkina faso .

-1
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .

-1
while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's animal house .

-1
. . . unlike [ scorsese 's mean streets ] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .

-1
though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .

-1
even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .

-1
no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também .

-1
the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .

-1
it does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch .

-1
a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .

-1
. . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .

-1
when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .

-1
dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .

-1
the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .

-1
each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .

-1
spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .

-1
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .

-1
the whole film has this sneaky feel to it  as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product .

-1
however stale the material , lawrence 's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny .

-1
a non-mystery mystery .

-1
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .

-1
not only are the film 's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we 're -doing-it-for -the-cash ' sequel were .

-1
despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .

-1
even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .

-1
. . . unbearably lame .

-1
simplistic , silly and tedious .

-1
the film 's most improbable feat ? it did n't go straight to video .

-1
low comedy does n't come much lower .

-1
this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong 's john woo . he 's not good with people .

-1
harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .

-1
as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .

-1
it 's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen .

-1
most of the action setups are incoherent .

-1
friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it 's called where 's chris tucker when you need him ?

-1
this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .

-1
is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful .

-1
a sour , nasty offering .

-1
there 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .

-1
the fact that the 'best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .

-1
what is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .

-1
rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .

-1
the irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .

-1
seems like someone going through the motions .

-1
ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what 's the point ? '

-1
with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .

-1
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .

-1
this is the first film i 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .

-1
slap me , i saw this movie .

-1
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes .

-1
this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .

-1
the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card .

-1
the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .

-1
the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [ this ] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot .

-1
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` saving private ryan `` battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?

-1
putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora 's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .

-1
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .

-1
this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .

-1
you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .

-1
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .

-1
the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .

-1
terminally brain dead production .

-1
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .

-1
as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .

-1
. . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .

-1
who is this movie for ? not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance . it 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '

-1
any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .

-1
without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers .

-1
while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .

-1
it 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .

-1
it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you 're in need of a cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .

-1
the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .

-1
chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .

-1
the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .

-1
the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .

-1
if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option .

-1
audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .

-1
those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering .

-1
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens .

-1
one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .

-1
press the delete key .

-1
the film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .

-1
there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .

-1
cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds .

-1
poor ben bratt could n't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .

-1
it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .

-1
i 'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .

-1
. . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol ' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .

-1
patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .

-1
like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .

-1
. . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .

-1
so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy .

-1
the superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .

-1
no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone 's guess .

-1
with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .

-1
far more enjoyable than its predecessor .

-1
it 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .

-1
adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ?

-1
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .

-1
woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .

-1
none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with `` xxx `` is that its own action is n't very effective .

-1
director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` the longest yard `` playbook like a checklist .

-1
this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .

-1
it 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante 's similarly styled gremlins .

-1
i still ca n't relate to stuart : he 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .

-1
shankman . . . and screenwriter karen janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of bible parables and not an actual story .

-1
this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .

-1
a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .

-1
bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .

-1
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .

-1
call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .

-1
the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .

-1
if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but was n't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor .

-1
el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors .

-1
any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors .

-1
there 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .

-1
as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .

-1
fairly run-of-the-mill .

-1
while there 's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer

-1
amazingly dopey .

-1
love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly was n't feeling any of it .

-1
k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .

-1
birot 's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) is n't so much bad as it is bland .

-1
thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together .

-1
has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .

-1
no way i can believe this load of junk .

-1
the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .

-1
philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .

-1
what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .

-1
no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .

-1
typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names .

-1
'would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '

-1
. . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .

-1
it 's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell .

-1
while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river 's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby 's main overall flaw .

-1
the master of disguise represents adam sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .

-1
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .

-1
the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .

-1
a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .

-1
this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .

-1
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .

-1
beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [ but ] the script goes wrong at several key junctures .

-1
narc is all menace and atmosphere .

-1
bluto blutarsky , we miss you .

-1
this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .

-1
kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) .

-1
the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .

-1
donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .

-1
truly terrible .

-1
i ca n't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops .

-1
a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it does n't work .

-1
a few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .

-1
comes across as a fairly weak retooling .

-1
for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck 's film from coming together .

-1
if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's john turturro , who 's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish .

-1
whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , i ca n't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .

-1
i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women .

-1
definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .

-1
by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .

-1
for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless .

-1
moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .

-1
devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects .

-1
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .

-1
. . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .

-1
a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .

-1
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .

-1
a cockeyed shot all the way .

-1
as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .

-1
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination .

-1
. curiously , super troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .

-1
could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes .

-1
in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .

-1
the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .

-1
it 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .

-1
truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .

-1
an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .

-1
[ gayton 's script ] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .

-1
weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .

-1
. . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .

-1
it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .

-1
a wordy wisp of a comedy .

-1
rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .

-1
an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .

-1
will anyone who is n't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?

-1
i 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year .

-1
o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados .

-1
what 's next : `` my mother the car ? ``

-1
yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .

-1
feels familiar and tired .

-1
walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .

-1
some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .

-1
lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) .

-1
another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .

-1
[ t ] he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .

-1
once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .

-1
here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .

-1
caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia .

-1
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .

-1
madonna still ca n't act a lick .

-1
the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .

-1
marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .

-1
`` the tuxedo `` should have been the vehicle for chan that `` the mask `` was for jim carrey . alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .

-1
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .

-1
the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .

-1
overly stylized with lots of flash black- & -white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it 's ) at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .

-1
`` roger michell ( `` notting hill `` ) directs a morality thriller . ``

-1
a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .

-1
a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .

-1
might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .

-1
bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it .

-1
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .

-1
the film 's center will not hold .

-1
been there done that .

-1
este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas .

-1
kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .

-1
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .

-1
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .

-1
while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other .

-1
while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .

-1
a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .

-1
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .

-1
an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .

-1
pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal .

-1
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .

-1
the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .

-1
it 's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .

-1
alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors .

-1
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .

-1
the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .

-1
talky , artificial and opaque . . . an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .

-1
a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .

-1
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding

-1
the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .

-1
pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .

-1
when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .

-1
every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .

-1
the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately .

-1
fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .

-1
in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '

-1
the irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .

-1
`` collateral damage `` goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief

-1
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance

-1
it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .

-1
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .

-1
care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .

-1
. . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .

-1
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions .

-1
there 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .

-1
the script kicks in , and mr . hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .

-1
this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .

-1
the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys .

-1
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .

-1
give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .

-1
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut .

-1
a dreadful live-action movie .

-1
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .

-1
a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .

-1
some episodes work , some do n't .

-1
master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .

-1
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .

-1
does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past .

-1
when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray 's game of chinese whispers with mr bean .

-1
children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .

-1
a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans .

-1
it 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .

-1
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .

-1
a negligible british comedy .

-1
though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .

-1
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image .

-1
. . . irritating soul-searching garbage .

-1
the title , alone , should scare any sane person away .

-1
it 's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` got aids yet ? ``

-1
this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .

-1
[ lee ] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .

-1
the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back .

-1
been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional .

-1
'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '

-1
a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis .

-1
is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ?

-1
too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .

-1
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .

-1
bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .

-1
his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .

-1
even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of todd farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .

-1
it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag .

-1
both awful and appealing .

-1
so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .

-1
this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .

-1
. . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .

-1
a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .

-1
if you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at britney spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .

-1
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece ' and 'triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .

-1
director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .

-1
is `` ballistic `` worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer .

-1
it never rises to its clever what-if concept .

-1
broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .

-1
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .

-1
basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars .

-1
it appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .

-1
a thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing ' and a geriatric 'scream . '

-1
watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures .

-1
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . .

-1
the film did n't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago 's south side .

-1
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so

-1
scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you 're too buff / fred thinks he 's tough / and velma - wow , you 've lost weight !

-1
it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .

-1
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .

-1
enough similarities to gymkata and howie long 's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .

-1
a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .

-1
there 's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .

-1
as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling .

-1
a lifetime movie about men .

-1
by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .

-1
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .

-1
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .

-1
it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .

-1
one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .

-1
some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .

-1
a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .

-1
a singularly off-putting romantic comedy .

-1
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let 's get this thing over with ' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .

-1
final verdict : you 've seen it all before .

-1
a workshop mentality prevails .

-1
entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .

-1
one of the worst films of 2002 .

-1
`` one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? `` um . . is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?

-1
the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .

-1
. . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .

-1
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .

-1
nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .

-1
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .

-1
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .

-1
there 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side .

-1
the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .

-1
herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola 's inadequate performance .

-1
in the end , white oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel . it 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .

-1
ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .

-1
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .

-1
there 's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that ' hanging over the film . it 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .

-1
those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .

-1
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .

-1
wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss barbershop out of hand .

-1
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .

-1
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .

-1
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least -- annoying , is n't it ?

-1
i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .

-1
in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .

-1
criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama .

-1
this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .

-1
millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry .

-1
evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .

-1
hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .

-1
as saccharine as it is disposable .

-1
no amount of nostalgia for carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .

-1
a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .

-1
has none of the crackle of `` fatal attraction `` , `` 9 ½ weeks `` , or even `` indecent proposal `` , and feels more like lyne 's stolid remake of `` lolita `` .

-1
it 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .

-1
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .

-1
there 's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever .

-1
absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man 's navel .

-1
scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .

-1
wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema ' award .

-1
lame , haphazard teen comedy .

-1
all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n ' sandal adventure .

-1
[ less a movie than ] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment .

-1
though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal woody at best .

-1
just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .

-1
`` freaky friday , `` it 's not .

-1
after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget .

-1
oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough

-1
scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .

-1
show me the mugging .

-1
the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .

-1
mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i 'd hoped the movie would avoid .

-1
this is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .

-1
. . . feels as if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .

-1
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob 's excellent adventure seem understated .

-1
a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .

-1
a dreary indulgence .

-1
comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief .

-1
thin period piece .

-1
it 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .

-1
the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .

-1
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .

-1
deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .

-1
it 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .

-1
bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .

-1
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .

-1
the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .

-1
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron ' anderson , seems entirely improvised .

-1
if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg .

-1
a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .

-1
there 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .

-1
is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco 's last album ?

-1
while some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .

-1
the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .

-1
puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .

-1
the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .

-1
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .

-1
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .

-1
definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum .

-1
whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes .

-1
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna .

-1
slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .

-1
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .

-1
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen 's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins .

-1
once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .

-1
solaris `` is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .

-1
it 's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that .

-1
this is a heartfelt story . . . it just is n't a very involving one .

-1
below is well below expectations .

-1
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .

-1
anemic , pretentious .

-1
a sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .

-1
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .

-1
however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .

-1
as plain and pedestrian as catsup --

-1
you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup .

-1
generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style .

-1
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .

-1
there 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .

-1
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .

-1
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .

-1
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .

-1
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures .

-1
[ e ] ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .

-1
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there 's something about mary co-writer ed decter .

-1
. . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school .

-1
a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .

-1
a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen .

-1
i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that 's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing .

-1
the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material .

-1
a very average science fiction film .

-1
if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .

-1
an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .

-1
the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .

-1
due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .

-1
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .

-1
while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .

-1
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd .

-1
formulaic to the 51st power , more like .

-1
. . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .

-1
a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .

-1
just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .

-1
humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .

-1
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .

-1
degenerates into hogwash .

-1
the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .

-1
the movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .

-1
conforms itself with creating a game of 'who 's who ' . . . where the characters ' moves are often more predictable than their consequences .

-1
it 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .

-1
the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .

-1
koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .

-1
if only it were , well , funnier .

-1
the latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler 's reigen .

-1
a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .

-1
an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .

-1
has all the depth of a wading pool .

-1
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .

-1
you 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .

-1
unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .

-1
this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .

-1
the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .

-1
director david fincher and writer david koepp ca n't sustain it .

-1
`` an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ``

-1
the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .

-1
beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .

-1
it 's one long bore .

-1
this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .

-1
the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [ but ] from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .

-1
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .

-1
this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story .

-1
the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .

-1
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .

-1
feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network .

-1
an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .

-1
ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability .

-1
every note rings false .

-1
it 's slow -- very , very slow . it 's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that 's pure pr hype .

-1
despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .

-1
'all in all , reign of fire will be a good ( successful ) rental . '

-1
a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .

-1
the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .

-1
nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget .

-1
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .

-1
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .

-1
one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .

-1
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time .

-1
. . . the movie is just a plain old monster .

-1
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect .

-1
it just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .

-1
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .

-1
a quaint , romanticized rendering .

-1
brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors . . . by shoving them into every clichéd white-trash situation imaginable .

-1
k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .

-1
yo , it 's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo .

-1
consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .

-1
murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .

-1
. . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .

-1
a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products .

-1
the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .

-1
it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .

-1
i 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .

-1
although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .

-1
it 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .

-1
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks .

-1
a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .

-1
so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie .

-1
yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .

-1
. . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare 's macbeth does n't sustain a high enough level of invention .

-1
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .

-1
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .

-1
it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .

-1
after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no .

-1
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .

-1
[ hell is ] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara is n't even halfway through .

-1
the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .

-1
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .

-1
lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .

-1
despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america 's sweetheart .

-1
i 'm just too bored to care .

-1
the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .

-1
the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .

-1
some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .

-1
ihops do n't pile on this much syrup .

-1
as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .

-1
the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .

-1
bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .

-1
a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation .

-1
the movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .

-1
it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .

-1
a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip .

-1
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .

-1
does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters

-1
a pretentious mess .

-1
not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .

-1
these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector .

-1
propelled not by characters but by caricatures .

-1
taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .

-1
it 's harmless , diverting fluff . but it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .

-1
credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves

-1
one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .

-1
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .

-1
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .

-1
a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug .

-1
this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .

-1
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .

-1
instead of trying to bust some blondes , [ diggs ] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .

-1
with a `` spy kids `` sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` snl `` has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ?

-1
the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .

-1
bearable . barely .

-1
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .

-1
a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .

-1
what you get with empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead .

-1
star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .

-1
the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling .

-1
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .

-1
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .

-1
gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .

-1
this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .

-1
outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .

-1
a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

-1
the film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking .

-1
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .

-1
in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni 's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .

-1
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

-1
the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) .

-1
starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .

-1
the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .

-1
it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .

-1
it virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .

-1
got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length .

-1
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .

-1
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that 's something i would rather live in denial about

-1
sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .

-1
once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .

-1
consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .

-1
warmed-over hash .

-1
the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .

-1
the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .

-1
there 's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .

-1
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .

-1
even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .

-1
the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne 's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea ' and the george pal version of h . g . wells ' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .

-1
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .

-1
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .

-1
if you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .

-1
there 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .

-1
why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there 's no good answer to that one .

-1
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .

-1
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .

-1
this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .

-1
the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .

-1
none of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .

-1
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .

-1
starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches .

-1
deserving of its critical backlash and more .

-1
horrible

-1
an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .

-1
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .

-1
watching trouble every day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .

-1
. . . has virtually no script at all . . .

-1
john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it 's also stupider .

-1
more tiring than anything .

-1
the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .

-1
a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash .

-1
simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .

-1
dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .

-1
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .

-1
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .

-1
crummy

-1
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .

-1
the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .

-1
despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .

-1
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .

-1
a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .

-1
es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . .

-1
the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .

-1
some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .

-1
both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .

-1
the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes

-1
`` what john does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , `` one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .

-1
feels like a cold old man going through the motions .

-1
a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .

-1
all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit .

-1
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .

-1
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .

-1
a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .

-1
one thing 's for sureif george romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .

-1
[ n ] o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .

-1
first good , then bothersome . excellent acting and direction .

-1
this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio .

-1
even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .

-1
grating and tedious .

-1
releasing a film with the word 'dog ' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them .

-1
not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .

-1
you may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .

-1
hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .

-1
its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .

-1
confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it .

-1
. . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .

-1
god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .

-1
it 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .

-1
plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .

-1
a complete waste of time .

-1
director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime 's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks .

-1
the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times

-1
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .

-1
warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .

-1
a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .

-1
hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .

-1
davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .

-1
contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .

-1
a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .

-1
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .

-1
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .

-1
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .

-1
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '

-1
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .

-1
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .

-1
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .

-1
it 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .

-1
you come away thinking not only that kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .

-1
at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .

-1
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .

-1
there are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv .

-1
this is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .

-1
instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources  good sources , bad mixture

-1
we just do n't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .

-1
. . . they missed the boat .

-1
a great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell does n't even have a great ending .

-1
unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .

-1
it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .

-1
crikey indeed .

-1
in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .

-1
a noble failure .

-1
veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda .

-1
not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .

-1
better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .

-1
it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .

-1
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .

-1
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .

-1
on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .

-1
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more .

-1
the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .

-1
makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .

-1
for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .

-1
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .

-1
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .

-1
the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film .

-1
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .

-1
maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` full frontal `` seems , well , contrived .

-1
we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting .

-1
ruh-roh ! romething 's really wrong with this ricture !

-1
. . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .

-1
i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .

-1
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .

-1
just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation .

-1
no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .

-1
horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .

-1
what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .

-1
blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .

-1
an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .

-1
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .

-1
despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .

-1
it 's exactly the kind of movie toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .

-1
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more .

-1
reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad .

-1
a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .

-1
it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd .

-1
it 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [ woo 's ] best work .

-1
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` crossroads `` instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .

-1
the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .

-1
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .

-1
painfully padded .

-1
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .

-1
the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids .

-1
the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .

-1
will no doubt delight plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .

-1
what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ?

-1
attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .

-1
delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas .

-1
it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .

-1
after a while , hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .

-1
the pool drowned me in boredom .

-1
blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` pretty woman `` retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .

-1
i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i 'm not , and then i realized that i just did n't care .

-1
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .

-1
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .

-1
i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .

-1
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .

-1
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .

-1
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .

-1
die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .

-1
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .

-1
while it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .

-1
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that 's neither .

-1
it 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .

-1
dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .

-1
as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away ' sinks .

-1
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .

-1
essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .

-1
a processed comedy chop suey .

-1
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .

-1
. . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .

-1
. . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be

-1
includes too much obvious padding .

-1
[ screenwriter ] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .

-1
shallow , noisy and pretentious .

-1
at the bottom rung of the series ' entries .

-1
everything about girls ca n't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .

-1
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .

-1
sadly , hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .

-1
ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .

-1
perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .

-1
chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .

-1
black-and-white and unrealistic .

-1
frankly , it 's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller 's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there 's plenty to offend everyone . . .

-1
a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .

-1
there 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .

-1
too much of the humor falls flat .

-1
distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .

-1
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g

-1
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water ' story . you 've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does .

-1
the screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .

-1
it 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill .

-1
there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .

-1
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply

-1
skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .

-1
it 's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance .

-1
it 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .

-1
throw smoochy from the train !

-1
control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible

-1
a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures .

-1
succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies .

-1
you can practically hear george orwell turning over .

-1
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .

-1
not so much farcical as sour .

-1
like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .

-1
a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale .

-1
even with harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .

-1
feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .

-1
a little too pat for its own good .

-1
children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers .

-1
by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it 's not an easy one to review .

-1
such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .

-1
unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title .

-1
charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing .

-1
it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .

-1
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation .

-1
la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .

-1
. . . hypnotically dull .

-1
perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .

-1
my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .

-1
no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .

-1
pascale bailly 's rom-com provides amélie 's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest .

-1
the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .

-1
samira makhmalbaf 's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal

-1
bad and baffling from the get-go .

-1
i 've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .

-1
extremely bad .

-1
director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10 , 000 times .

-1
demands too much of most viewers .

-1
it 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .

-1
this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .

-1
the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .

-1
despite bearing the paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement european pickup . what 's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there

-1
less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan .

-1
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .

-1
an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .

-1
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .

-1
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .

-1
it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .

-1
howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective .

-1
little more than a frothy vanity project .

-1
my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .

-1
tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .

-1
a movie to forget

-1
for dance completists only .

-1
in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that .

-1
there 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .

-1
the only thing to fear about `` fear dot com `` is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .

-1
the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .

-1
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .

-1
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss .

-1
clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .

-1
it 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .

-1
be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .

-1
do n't waste your money .

-1
it 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .

-1
the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .

-1
just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .

-1
to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .

-1
shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .

-1
a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .

-1
`` men in black ii , `` has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?

-1
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .

-1
ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ai n't none , you have a problem .

-1
a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .

-1
if this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .

-1
even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .

-1
affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that ford effortlessly filled with authority .

-1
laughably , irredeemably awful .

-1
his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .

-1
scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .

-1
whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing 's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary .

-1
the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .

-1
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .

-1
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .

1
skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise .

1
another love story in 2002 's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre .

1
proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .

1
this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy .

1
there 's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that 's what makes it irresistible .

1
unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners .

1
where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable .

1
maybe thomas wolfe was right : you ca n't go home again .

1
a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry .

1
there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way .

1
as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm .

1
instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it 's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .

1
an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china .

1
if you 're a fan of the series you 'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be .

1
the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .

1
pacino is the best he 's been in years and keener is marvelous .

1
remember the kind of movie we were hoping `` ecks vs . sever `` or `` xxx `` was going to be ? this is it .

1
maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts .

1
monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds .

1
like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong 's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting .

1
grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length

1
a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli .

1
a genuine mind-bender .

1
performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances .

1
as home movie gone haywire , it 's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i 'd rather listen to old tori amos records .

1
it 's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast .

1
good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .

1
it 's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul .

1
the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you ca n't fight your culture .

1
all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .

1
this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed .

1
if there 's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic .

1
it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .

1
a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody , and to belong to somebody .

1
a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it 's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones .

1
one of the best , most understated performances of [ jack nicholson 's ] career .

1
wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too .

1
thanks to scott 's charismatic roger and eisenberg 's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men .

1
parker holds true to wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .

1
although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel .

1
a weird , arresting little ride .

1
can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ?

1
the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations .

1
reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .

1
i have a new favorite musical -- and i 'm not even a fan of the genre

1
if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster .

1
this is carion 's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach .

1
superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line .

1
a good piece of work more often than not .

1
reminiscent of alfred hitchcock 's thrillers , most of the scary parts in 'signs ' occur while waiting for things to happen .

1
an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era .

1
it 's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .

1
this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful .

1
. . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind .

1
hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare .

1
as green-guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut .

1
it 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force .

1
the movie is amateurish , but it 's a minor treat .

1
although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real .

1
one from the heart .

1
i 'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming ' because it usually means 'schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming .

1
throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .

1
if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on .

1
it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .

1
the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .

1
this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you wo n't exactly know what 's happening but you 'll be blissfully exhausted .

1
world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .

1
a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society .

1
a photographic marvel of sorts , and it 's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community .

1
isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries .

1
a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son 's home after decades away .

1
this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards .

1
parker can not sustain the buoyant energy level of the film 's city beginnings into its country conclusion

1
will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues .

1
the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense .

1
this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .

1
a painfully funny ode to bad behavior .

1
this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help .

1
it 's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america .

1
bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he 'll get the girl . he 's super spy !

1
it 's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .

1
the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .

1
at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance .

1
though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .

1
a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise .

1
one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever .

1
angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately .

1
. . . either you 're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you 're not .

1
this is n't a narrative film -- i do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i 'm sure some will try -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come .

1
films are made of little moments . changing lanes tries for more . it does n't reach them , but the effort is gratefully received .

1
one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .

1
provides the kind of 'laugh therapy ' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already .

1
an ambitious and moving but bleak film .

1
a witty , low-key romantic comedy .

1
we know the plot 's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish .

1
a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman .

1
binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles .

1
spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don ' t know an orc from a uruk-hai .

1
the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed .

1
[ lawrence bounces ] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place .

1
schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation .

1
ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it .

1
a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted .

1
has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 `` at the end of its title .

1
zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure .

1
a riveting story well told .

1
all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon .

1
smarter than its commercials make it seem .

1
what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .

1
we want the funk - and this movie 's got it .

1
`` mostly martha `` is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see .

1
the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events .

1
it 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest .

1
both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it 's tremendously moving .

1
ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .

1
although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey

1
