when you open it wakes up almost immediately .

1
great color on screen .

1
i highly recommend ! !

1
reliability : throughout the past few years , i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws .

1
for windows users switching to a mac , you can also enable right clicking ( known to apple as secondary click ) in the system preferences & gt ; mouse and enabling right clicking .

1
way to go and enjoy both worlds .

1
this is the best switch i have ever done .

1
this is larger laptop , but is not too heavy .

1
i gave this product 5 stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price .

1
it was delivered with 4gb of ram -- 2gb on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate .

1
but , hey , it 's an apple .

1
mac user interface is just the best .

1
i love this laptop .

1
i 've been to the & amp ; # 34 ; genius & amp ; # 34 ; bar several times ( they have been very nice ) .

1
i can use it as a tablet , as a laptop , as whatever i want to !

1
however , a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon , but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead .

1
music/videos sound great and look great .

1
the battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours , making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger .

1
the processor and gpu are fantastic at running games and multiple apps .

1
lastly , because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard .

1
what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side , apple 's osx mountain lion , the sleek looks apple always delivers , reasonable specs , good battery life , nice keyboard , and excellent trackpad .

1
the machine now has 10 gigs of ram and it works just fine .

1
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all .

1
runs fast , the touch screen has n't lost any sensitivity , i 'm overall very happy with it .

1
o it is extremely user friendly .

1
well , my first apple computer and i am impressed .

1
i tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon , but ... you 're just living in denial if you do n't .

1
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time .

1
the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display , not in the least the mac pro works just fine .

1
it takes less time to power up , and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode .

1
all i can say is i am impressed .

1
my first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also , brilliant .

1
like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and i 'm excited to do it .

1
this is my first apple computer and i could n't be more pleased .

1
apps launch super fast , and the 500gb hdd is more than sufficient .

1
they really know what they are doing .

1
it runs fast !

1
the backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially .

1
i appreciate the relatively large keyboard ( with number pad ) and screen size .

1
durability : my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it , but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it .

1
the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized , lazy , and eye candy person in all of us .

1
when the macbook pro arrived , i helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac ... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive .

1
three years ago i had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great !

1
the best computer i 've ever bought .

1
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair .

1
pay me now , pay me later ... ... ... i am happy with my choice going with this laptop .

1
have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever .

1
this was the only tablet-style computer so far which met my requirements .

1
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it 's simple to use user interface .

1
the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal .

1
i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing , so the entry-level 13 ' macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for .

1
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable .

1
this is a great laptop .

1
this asus you 're looking at right here , and that i 'm typing on right now , has one .

1
this computer is like ... i 'm lost for words .

1
i play sims 4 and 3 on it all the time , with very little issues .

1
if you want to use the internet , then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen , like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon .

1
i tested it , it worked great .

1
this laptop was made for art , music , beat-making , pictures , movies , graphic design .

1
as a student majoring computer science , i really fell in love with this laptop .

1
the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus .

1
great battery life .

1
get this now ! ! !

1
it 's also incredibly light , has a battery that can last for days , and looks like a piece of art .

1
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature .

1
out of all the laptops i have owned , this is by far the best !

1
overall i love it .

1
o others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for , for example engineering majors need extra applications & amp ; systems to do some work , but they are easily downloadable .

1
its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great , aside from its quality design and sexy looks .

1
overall great for me ! ! !

1
my favorite computer i 've ever had !

1
hard drives can be replaced , ram can be added as needed , and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge .

1
5 . and this has a extra slot for hdd

1
otherwise i am happily a mac user .

1
i 'm actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it !

1
the batter lasts as long as claimed .

1
the snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos , as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy .

1
very nice .

1
i am sure it will be able to do all i need it to do in the future as well .

1
the screen is great , i do n't see the need for a retina display .

1
- it has 256gb ssd which is just enough for my os , games , documents , and anything in between .

1
this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing , searching the internet , and keeping track of everyday life .

1
i bought this a few months ago and it 's holding up fairly well .

1
- this laptop is so silent , its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load , thanks to the 5th generation intel core which draws less power , thus less heat .

1
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide .

1
it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems !

1
i 've been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem .

1
this is very fast , high performance computer .

1
its been easy breezy since then .

1
it looks and feels solid , with a flawless finish .

1
i bought my macbook pro in october of 2012 and 2 years later it still works as flawless as ever !

1
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing .

1
it 's very sturdy .

1
we do n't have to de-frag , deliete cookies , run security programs , or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed .

1
it 's worth it .

1
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one .

1
the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down .

1
soon i will be hitting the 5 year mark and i think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion .

1
the thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go .

1
5. bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed ( because of my doings )

1
i like the 13 inch macbooks .

1
it 's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen .

1
what a great laptop , i can run my games and work really fast .

1
well , my first impressions are that its ok , it certainly boots up quickly ( thanks ssd ! ) , and from the limited use so far ( no games ) its fast enough in normal usage .

1
the os is easy , and offers all kinds of surprises .

1
i hate plugging my laptop in because i do n't want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery , but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it .

1
it is an older model , so know that upfront , but it is everything i was looking for .

1
blends in with any accessory you use with it .

1
everything at a very great price .

1
even the battery life is like wow !

1
it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you do n't need .

1
i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice .

1
it 's light , fast and has great battery ! !

1
you will not regret buying this computer !

1
very great apple product as expected .

1
never had any issues , no frustrations just great easy wireless , all in one fun !

1
if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please do n't be .

1
it has the latest i7 cpu with a gtx 950m for gpu , which makes this laptop blazing fast ( boots up in under 5 seconds , with the help of the ssd of course ) .

1
i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'show all bookmarks ' icon ( the open book icon at the upper left ) .

1
- touchscreen is great .

1
i 'm very pleased with the purchase .

1
so i simply pulled one 2gb stick from the machine and installed the 8gb stick in its place .

1
because it is a touch screen you do n't even need a mouse .

1
also , the resale value on this will keep .

1
that 's a pretty impressive track record do n't you think ?

1
the investment is worth it .

1
i was seduced by this computer , so i took it home .

1
i 've had it for more than a year , and i 've found that no anti-virus software is needed , as long as you do n't download anything without being 100 % sure that it 's from a legitimate source .

1
macs hardly ever get viruses , and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses .

1
the glass track pad is large enough for apple 's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers , zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers , accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers .

1
but apple does not pretend it has any of these .

1
i 'm excited for el capitan .

1
ios does everything its billed to do and much , much more .

1
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit , which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing ( typing ? ) .

1
2 . 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as i am ( dj , photography , movie making , etc ) its quick !

1
i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10 , but it is pretty awesome .

1
pros : o it usually runs very smoothly , but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers .

1
i 'm overall very pleased with my new laptop ! ! !

1
i really like mac/apple products because of their operating system .

1
i had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students , and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use .

1
i use it everyday .

1
can be used for gaming as well .

1
i completely recommend it .

1
if i were to have any technical difficulties , the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap , it was quite impressive .

1
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied .

1
the metal is very expensive feeling .

1
i am pleased with my decision , however i have only had this for a few weeks .

1
boot time is super fast , around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute .

1
the wireless adapter is strong and the ssd is fast .

1
i bought it for college and could n't be happier .

1
if you draw on the other hand i 'm sure you will love using this in tablet mode .

1
i highly recommend you get one before they are gone .

1
the macbook pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes :

1
the macbook pro is useful for college students for many reasons :

1
there is so much room !

1
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies , without having the keyboard in the way of things .

1
also , the laptop is quite , no more burnt laps , best screen display , and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over .

1
overall , the screen resolution , though non-retina , is sufficient for normal web browsing and work .

1
usability : the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who does n't necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers .

1
i 've only had this for a week overall i like the computer , it 's thin & amp ; light and the wireless keyboard works great .

1
6 . no cd drive .

1
positives : - no matter what position , this laptop will stay in it .

1
you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it 's nice to know you have that option .

1
the computer of the people !

1
if you are looking for a light , durable , and extremely effecient laptop , buy this one !

1
first off , amazing laptop !

1
i am very satisfied with everything about this machine .

1
it has done everything and more that i expected .

1
good speakers from laptop computer .

1
- it looks sleek and gorgeous .

1
love this computer .

1
the screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice .

1
overall , i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop .

1
plus you get 500gb which is also a great feature .

1
it 's great .

1
plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop , i really do n't have anything to compare it to .

1
i was impressed ; sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger .

1
cons : o some people do n't enjoy the way the processing system runs , but do n't have any issues with getting it to function .

1
was the best decision we ever made .

1
that is plenty of space for your laptop , which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers .

1
i 'm no power user , but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i do n't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os .

1
- quick boot-up , and runs efficiently .

1
it makes it much more exciting to play !

1
the thunderbolt port is awesome !

1
i get about 5 or so hours playing the sims .

1
all in all i am very happy with this purchase .

1
this computer overall is great !

1
the mac app store is your one-stop shop for mac software , though you can also download software online at your own risk .

1
the touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes .

1
the resolution is excellent .

1
over all very good system and worth it .

1
the screen has an extremely high resolution that i 'm very pleased with .

1
i can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed .

1
it runs faster than it did when i got it .

1
my new laptop is great .

1
the screen looked fine to me and was n't an issue like others have been saying .

1
i love the new high retina display , and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter .

1
and with this price , i do n't think you can buy anything better .

1
furthermore , mac os x mountain lion 's gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans , which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed .

1
this mac allows all of that .

1
the wifi works great .

1
so far so good , i have not encountered any issues with this computer .

1
glad i did so far .

1
if you are looking to get a 2-in-1 laptop , this is the laptop you should consider .

1
there are currently around 10,000 apps on the app store ( and counting ... ) , and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store .

1
this is a fantastic transformer !

1
it 's portable , reliable , and great for what i use it for .

1
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid .

1
this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop .

1
and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free !

1
i would n't expect anything less !

1
you ca n't get a virus on mac , so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security , and not having to replace your computer every year or two .

1
if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac .

1
2-in-1 capability- the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus .

1
how could you not love a mac

1
i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac !

1
this macbook pro is amazing !

1
- it 's lightweight and easy to carry around .

1
i 'll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself , and just conclude by saying that i 'm delighted with my purchase .

1
overall , this is a fast , light , practical computer and i highly recommend it .

1
i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform .

1
- it 's not touchscreen !

1
i 'm sure you wo n't regret making this purchase .

1
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable .

1
i can usually go about 10 hours before i get down to 10 % battery life .

1
mine has been though hundreds of parties , weddings , quinces , anything involving performances , it can take it !

1
i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well .

1
this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone .

1
so far i have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future .

1
4. build solid and durable

1
one os for this platform , no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates .

1
the ssd and i7 complement each other really well .

1
i ca n't believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes .

1
this laptop has delivered .

1
also , if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus .

1
- it can run games really well .

1
great computer .

1
by the way ... i paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grand ... look at the price now !

1
the computer it self is amazing .

1
works well , fast and no reboots .

1
bought this laptop from best buy in january 2015.. still loving it .

1
replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy , a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play .

1
that 's the only issue i 've ever had since working on macs in 1995 .

1
i 'm not sure if it was covered in the description , but it does have a backlit keyboard and i 'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge ( except i do n't use this for games or videos , which obviously would drain the battery faster ) .

1
everything you 'd expect from a mac .

1
when i decided to buy my first computer , i wish i had bought a mac first .

1
it is the cheapest product in the line of macbook 's

1
the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files .

1
they were great .

1
the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use

1
all works beautifully but windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to .

1
you wont be disappointed with this computer !

1
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true .

1
to a prospective buyer , 08/10/2012 once you go mac , you 'll never go back .

1
i also like i have the option to push calendars , photos , and contacts to an ipad , ipod touch , or iphone ( if i had any of those ) .

1
the laptop is so easy to work with .

1
i bought this pc to play games and stream movies ! it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd !

1
o it has an extended battery life .

1
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp .

1
happy buying !

1
2 . keyboard is great

1
however , the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more .

1
overall , a solid laptop for its price .

1
this machine is flawless , fast , and classy .

1
i had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ( ccc ) and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds i had only dreamed up before .

1
my first mac computer and as many before me i just fall in love with it .

1
literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind .

1
love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great , but a little bit of a learning curve there too , as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need ...

1
though , that 's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device .

1
so long story short , if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop .

1
upgrading from a toshiba laptop , i am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides .

1
got this on black friday with a very good discount and could n't be happier .

1
the apps are very easy to use .

1
pros 1 . amazing storage ( both 500gig and 750gig )

1
us 3.0 comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps .

1
this has much more memory and ram memory .

1
so far so good .

1
the pros : a ton of storage space- this laptop comes with 8gb of memory and a 1 tb ( 1000gb ) hard drive .

1
i 'm looking forward to needing a laptop update so i can purchase this computer again .

1
i immediately did the windows 10 upgrade and have n't had any issues .

1
it 's a steal when considering the specs and performance as well .

1
it contains a long battery life , incredible specs , and an overall enjoyable performance .

1
you ca n't get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive .

1
i love , love , loooove !

1
the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad .

1
i like that .

1
battery life is great - though it is new .

1
for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value .

1
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop .

1
i 've been using apple 's since 1992 and this is the fastest and best one i 've had .

1
i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job

1
4 . sound is great

1
i also really like the addition of the sd card slot .

1
excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a macbook .

1
this computer is great .

1
the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool .

1
by the way , it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what i had just listed .

1
well she was right , whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works .

-1
the 15.6 & amp ; # 34 ; screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands .

-1
it seemed like a great computer and a great deal .

-1
the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light .

-1
this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times .

-1
instead they 'tightened ' a loose wire .

-1
we got two days of operation from this laptop .

-1
i went through the settings and there is n't a way to fix it .

-1
my laptop 's one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure .

-1
i would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy .

-1
the most disappointing purchase of my life !

-1
as a matter of fact , no matter how many times i asked that question , the employees i spoke purposely ignored it .

-1
this , added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money , detracts from the computer 's value .

-1
i wish this company to go bust .

-1
s ... . l ... . o ... .. w ... . rea ... ... llllyy slow .

-1
power on - good luck finding it .

-1
they did n't say yes and they did n't say no , they just pretended that i never asked it , which was incredibly frustrating .

-1
each time , apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over .

-1
glare is also pretty frustrating .

-1
within a day of usage , it already slowed down significantly , virus entered the system right away .

-1
the laptop refuses to start , we have troubleshooted all areas , still fails to start .

-1
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again .

-1
keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best .

-1
one of the worst pieces of electronics i have ever bought .

-1
the disks i made would n't work ... ..hp support stated & quot ; we 're a hardware company , not a software company. & quot ;

-1
no hdmi port .

-1
it took 3 days to make an appointment at the local apple store .

-1
it is very slow and not responsive .

-1
he explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal ' .

-1
to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down .

-1
5 . i found the track pad not great .

-1
now that they are not virus free ( [ ... ] l ) i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower , more expensive , and do not last as long .

-1
the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program , it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate .

-1
those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag , and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs .

-1
the battery lasted 12 months , then pffft ... ..gone .

-1
3 . can not manually take battery out , unless you work for apple or have the tools

-1
he received it , and one day later it dies .

-1
also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use ( could be i am pressing too hard perhaps ) , and the screen is well underwhelming .

-1
the touchpad is a little & quot ; clunky & quot ; for my taste ; i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event .

-1
impossible to use .

-1
i should have known better .

-1
( it 's a lemon ) .

-1
hp was no help .

-1
cons : 1 . web cam .

-1
however , i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive .

-1
i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix .

-1
i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i re-downloaded my amazon music ( losing my ratings ) .

-1
the speakers are fairly basic , so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies .

-1
apple does n't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care .

-1
before and after i resolved that issue , i saw the damn 'beachball ' all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it 's doing while i wait for it .

-1
can not even get to bios .

-1
the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer .

-1
i do't use it , i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus .

-1
a disk drive with buttons on it ! ! ! ! ! !

-1
only 2 usb ports .

-1
when i had a boot up issue , the hp recovery did n't work .

-1
the online customer service was awful .

-1
his reply astonished me , looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said : 'make sure you have your facts straight before you smear !

-1
vga really asus ? ?

-1
sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product .

-1
my daughter 's macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago .

-1
the only issue i had was with the harddrive .

-1
please google 'macbook battery bulge explode ' before you buy your next apple toy .

-1
it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out .

-1
i 'm a very weak girl and i could lift this laptop with one hand , however i 'd get tired soon lol .

-1
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine , told me there was a problem with the hardware , so i now have a & amp ; # 34 ; refurbished & amp ; # 34 ; machine .

-1
the wireless keyboard ( not bluetooth , but rf ) did not pair up with the device .

-1
there is definitely more to say ...

-1
i will never ever buy any apple product in my life .

-1
the trackpad is pretty crappy - but are n't they all ?

-1
this did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support .

-1
this company just wants customers ' money in their pocket .

-1
negatives : - as aforementioned , my only con was the updates .

-1
i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead .

-1
no one would ever answer my question as to why i could n't get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty .

-1
i think it may have to be 'apple do n't care ' instead of apple care .

-1
would not recommend .

-1
when i first got the computer , i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click .

-1
i still have weird freezing problems with it and it 's pretty slow , but it 's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in .

-1
this one does n't do that .

-1
note : no dvd drive , no ethernet port

-1
they do n't go very loud at all .

-1
the touch pad feel is a 4 on scale 1 - 10 .

-1
so i 'm going back to genius bar for visit # 6 .

-1
i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase .

-1
one thing i did't like is the stylus holder , it 's cheap plastic and does n't seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port .

-1
in fact i am completely frustrated .

-1
it takes for ever to wake it up .

-1
but sony does n't seem to have addressed it .

-1
do n't waste your money .

-1
so beware buyer , this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it .

-1
sometimes it comes back , sometimes not .

-1
so , i 'm cooled on mac buys .

-1
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile .

-1
i spend so much time waiting for it .

-1
i find myself adjusting it regularly .

-1
for a non-computer savvy person , it was very disappointing .

-1
first , when i move the screen to put it in tablet position , the hinge does n't seem totally solid .

-1
what this laptop does have is : - windows 8 , which is confusing as all get-out - tons of & amp ; # 34 ; bloatware & amp ; # 34 ; .

-1
the first one arrived and it did not work .

-1
the battery is simply considered 'consumable ' and not covered .

-1
not a big deal for me , but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac .

-1
i was disappointed .

-1
steve jobs is dead , so is apple .

-1
2 . sometimes when i stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on , other times it is a few seconds

-1
i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that mac/apple does not do games well .

-1
thank you asus . ( they do n't deserve to be capitalized )

-1
the free upgrade to mountain lion failed .

-1
i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough .

-1
not impressed with macintosh products .

-1
this machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem .

-1
: (

-1
like seriously - really slow .

-1
from time to time i get the 'spinning beach ball ' that holds up progress .

-1
i do n't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional .

-1
also , many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform .

-1
the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though & amp ; # 34 ; home sharing & amp ; # 34 ; ( i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer ) but i could not figure that out .

-1
they tried to tell me that the battery was n't covered by the warranty and it costs about $ 150 to replace .

-1
this is a horrible laptop .

-1
sometimes it stops receiving wifi signal , so i have to restart it .

-1
i regretted immediately .

-1
i hate windows 8 .

-1
i do n't have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support , search functions , or hold times ... ..dropped the hp and never looked back .

-1
i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine .

-1
also , and this maybe is another personal quirk , but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop .

-1
when i attach a mouse it 's fine but the touchpad is really annoying .

-1
my apple mac book pro has crashed three times , since i purchased it .

-1
nothing like the description says .

-1
plus - no russian input ? ? wtf

-1
my hp seemed great at first , then the problems started ... ..wireless adapter would just & quot ; disappear & quot ; and the system said it did n't have a network card .

-1
i still ca n't pair it .

-1
thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio ; the onboard speakers are just terrible .

-1
i 'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $ 129 for a new battery , $ 39 to replace it and $ 139 for a new keyboard .

-1
if your looking to be a trendy hipster who ca n't live without a mac , it 's a great buy .

-1
it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes wo n't let me download things that are harmful to my computer , but that 's what anti virus software is for lol .

-1
no more apple devices in my household .

-1
3 . remember its a dual core .

-1
within the first few months that i bought it , there was clearly a problem with the hard drive .

-1
i hope you do n't make the same mistake ...

-1
very pour performance .

-1
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple does n't consider the product defective .

-1
i believe this macbook pro was a lemon right out the gate .

-1
to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it .

-1
i ca n't believe people like these computers .

-1
the only problem i have is with windows 8 .

-1
my laptop was under coverage but when i gave it to them for repairs , they quoted me $ 755 for it .

-1
the cons : no disc drive- call me old fashioned , but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes .

-1
i had delusions of grandeur regarding apple 's & amp ; # 34 ; great customer service & amp ; # 34 ; and the & amp ; # 34 ; reliability of their machines & amp ; # 34 ; etc.. etc ... blah ... blah ...

-1
you get what you pay for , right ?

-1
i could see the disk drive on the side but it did n't seem to have a button on it ?

-1
you do n't want to show this to anyone : ) .

-1
the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it .

-1
4 . the fan kicks in even its not too hot .

-1
i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling .

-1
the only downside are the speakers .

-1
this laptop has no : - touchscreen - optical drives ( ok , a bit of a stretch , because that would eat up precious space in this monster ) - swivel or detachable screen

-1
mac is complicated and frustrating at moments .

-1
they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars .

-1
computer seemed sluggish for an intel core i5 device .

-1
when you look at the internal specs , the computer is only worth about $ 500 .

-1
of course , it dies 3 days past the return window .

-1
i 'm a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development .

-1
i used the ctrl-esc keys while turning on , and still nothing .

-1
and he said & quot ; this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious !

-1
just a click and a black screen .

-1
signed : not impressed

-1
the lettering wore off the keys , so you better be able to type blind .

-1
etc . but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck !

-1
he did n't specify who are 'they ' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5 ' posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers .

-1
it also has a big new scratch on the top cover .

-1
here is my take on all of this , the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china , hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school , call them geniuses , and bully everybody who complains about their product .

-1
i bought my first macbook exactly 5 months ago and was really happy with my new toy , but what was not my surprise when i turned it on 2 days ago and the screen was completely black .

-1
2 . viewing angles are not great .

-1
be sure the programs you need will work on a mac before you buy one !

-1
opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever , as do all programs that do not begin with an 'i ' .

-1
i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager .

-1
if it was possible to give them 0 start , i would have done it .
